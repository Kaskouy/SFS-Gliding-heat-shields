# SFS-Gliding-heat-shields
A mod for Spaceflight simulator that gives heat shields some lift capabilities

This mod is intended to mimic real capsules, that have such capacity, and to give the player some control over his reentry trajectory. You can simply change your trajectory by steering your capsule left and right.

You can use this to glide over the upper atmosphere to limit the heat load of your heat shield, or on the contrary, dive into the lower atmosphere to land faster. Generally speaking, this is useful to adjust your flying altitude if you realize that you didn't put your capsule on a very good trajectory, or if you want to aim for a particular landing zone. This capacity has also an interesting side effect, it makes your capsule more stable during reentry.
